# iPhone 15 Website Clone

This project is a clone of the official iPhone 15 website, built using modern web technologies including **React**, **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**, **Three.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to replicate the smooth and interactive user experience of Apple's website while showcasing the power of animations and 3D visuals in web design.

## Live Demo

## Features
- **Smooth Animations**: Leveraged GSAP to create engaging animations that mimic the fluidity of the original site.
- **3D Models and Interactions**: Used Three.js to display 3D elements that rotate and animate on user interactions, similar to Apple's product showcase.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the website is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
- **React Components**: The site is built in React for modular, reusable components and efficient rendering.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling state.
- **GSAP**: For smooth, high-performance animations.
- **Three.js**: To render 3D models and visual effects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and utility-first CSS design.
- **React Three Fiber**: Integration of Three.js with React for a more declarative approach to 3D rendering.
